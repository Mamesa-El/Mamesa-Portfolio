## Projects

### HuggingFace RESTful API Deployment

In this project, I deployed a machine learning model using **Hugging Face transformers** on **Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. The model was made accessible via RESTful APIs, and I implemented **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time monitoring of key performance metrics, such as request throughput and latency. The integration of **FastAPI** enabled rapid unit testing to ensure the robustness of the API endpoints.

#### Performance Overview

Using **Prometheus** and **Grafana** dashboards, I tracked and optimized resource usage while maintaining high performance under stress testing. The results of the testing revealed a system latency of under 10 microseconds and a throughput exceeding 100 requests per second.

The performance of the API was thoroughly tested using **k6.io** load testing. Below is a snapshot of the load test result:

The figure above (Figure 1) showcases the **K6** load testing results, highlighting metrics such as request duration and iterations per virtual user. These metrics helped identify bottlenecks and optimize the systemâ€™s performance further.

#### Service Monitoring

To monitor the real-time performance and health of services, I used **Grafana dashboards** integrated with **Prometheus**. This allowed for detailed monitoring of incoming requests, latency, and throughput. Below is a key dashboard showing service performance:

Figure 2 illustrates the real-time performance of services, allowing me to track response times and throughput, which were crucial in optimizing resource allocation during peak times.

### Key Achievements

- **Latency:** Maintained latency under 10 microseconds during peak load times.
- **Throughput:** Consistently handled more than 100 requests per second.
- **Monitoring:** Implemented **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to track resource usage and service health.
- **Load Testing:** Leveraged **k6** for stress testing, optimizing the API for high-performance environments.

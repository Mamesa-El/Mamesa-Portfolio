## Work Experience
**Data Scientist, Volt Lab Inc. | April, 2023 - February, 2024**
- Developed and managed machine learning algorithms using Scikit-Learn, NLP, and BERT for a spam
detection system, achieving an 80% F1 score through rigorous statistical analysis and model optimization.
- Designed and optimized SMS data pipelines using Python and SQL, integrating preprocessing, feature
engineering, and model selection techniques to achieve a 30% reduction in processing time.
- Maintained machine learning model lifecycle in AWS SageMaker, deploying models, managing batch
training, and securing endpoint access.
- Showcased strong written communication by authoring concise reports and presenting complex data
insights to non-technical teams, leading to significant reductions in client-generated spam.

**Data Analyst, Western Washington University | Sept 2019 - June, 2021**
- Analyzed spectroscopic data from 12 galaxy clusters using Python and Astropy to extract key properties,
applying anomaly detection methods to target extreme luminosity variations.
- Engineered scripts to efficiently analyze and visualize over 200,000 galaxies, developing practical ML
solutions that included properties and clustering analysis.

In this project, I deployed a machine learning model using **Hugging Face transformers** on **Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. The model was made accessible via RESTful APIs, and I implemented **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time monitoring of key performance metrics, such as request throughput and latency. The integration of **FastAPI** enabled rapid unit testing to ensure the robustness of the API endpoints.

#### Performance Overview

Using **Prometheus** and **Grafana** dashboards, I tracked and optimized resource usage while maintaining high performance under stress testing. The results of the testing revealed a system latency of under 10 microseconds and a throughput exceeding 100 requests per second.

The performance of the API was thoroughly tested using **k6.io** load testing. Below is a snapshot of the load test result:

*Figure 1: Load test results showing HTTP request durations, latency, and throughput under heavy load.*

The figure above (Figure 1) showcases the **K6** load testing results, highlighting metrics such as request duration and iterations per virtual user. These metrics helped identify bottlenecks and optimize the systemâ€™s performance further.

#### Service Monitoring

To monitor the real-time performance and health of services, I used **Grafana dashboards** integrated with **Prometheus**. This allowed for detailed monitoring of incoming requests, latency, and throughput. Below is a key dashboard showing service performance:

Figure 2 illustrates the real-time performance of services, allowing me to track response times and throughput, which were crucial in optimizing resource allocation during peak times.

### Key Achievements

- **Latency:** Maintained latency under 10 microseconds during peak load times.
- **Throughput:** Consistently handled more than 100 requests per second.
- **Monitoring:** Implemented **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to track resource usage and service health.
- **Load Testing:** Leveraged **k6** for stress testing, optimizing the API for high-performance environments.

This project analyzed social media influencers on platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok to understand engagement patterns and identify key factors contributing to influencer success. Using data from Kaggle, I focused on analyzing influencer categories, engagement metrics, and subscriber growth.

*Figure 2: Distribution of Top Influencers by Genre.*

**Key Insights**:
Dominant Categories: The Music and Music & Dance categories were the most popular (*shown in figure 2*), with Instagram and YouTube influencers in these categories having the highest total follower counts.

**Engagement Analysis**: There was a strong correlation between Authentic Engagement and Average Engagement on Instagram, indicating that influencers with high-quality interactions receive higher overall engagement.

**Platform Comparison**: Instagram was the top platform by total followers, followed by YouTube and TikTok.

**Technical Highlights**: Cleaned and normalized the dataset by removing duplicates and converting values with abbreviations (e.g., 'M', 'K') into numeric formats.
Applied Box-Cox Transformation to normalize skewed data distributions (*shown in figure 1*), improving the accuracy of correlation analysis and predictive modeling.
